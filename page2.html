        <div class="description"> The Hundun is an ancient Chinese creature known as the “being of chaos”. Said to have roamed the Earth long before humans, the Hundun has six feet, four wings, and no face. The creature has origins in Confucian, Taoist, and other early Chinese writings; however, all seem to depict the Hundun in slightly different ways. Confucian writing notes that the animal was a descendant of the Yellow Emperor and found joy in causing chaos and evil. Taoist stories mention that the Hundun once ruled as the emperor of the Middle Sea with Shu and Hu, the emperors of the Southern and Northern Seas. Some writings mention that they tried to give the Hundun eyes, ears, a nose and mouth by drilling holes into the animal which ultimately led to its death. The story shows that order cannot be made of chaos. The Hundun is also said to have enjoyed singing and dancing.
